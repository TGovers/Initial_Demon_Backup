## Initial Demon TLDR (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Initial Delay is a simple and intuitive VST plugin with an anime aesthetic. It utilises a 2-parameter IIR Filter and a single-parameter Delay. Initial Delay was designed for use with a multitude of different instruments in mind, such as
* Synths
* Baritone Electric Guitars
* 7/8 String Electric Guitars
* Bass Guitars
* And anything else you want to put through it, it's completely up to you!

Initial Delay has full automation and save state capabilities for easy use within your favourite DAW! Currently Initial Delay only has a Mac DMG installer, but can be used in Windows via the instructions detailed in the Installation Guide section.

Initial Demon was inspired by the anime "Initial D" and it's internet memes, click the link to the Youtube video below to **_witness the majesty that is Initial D_**

We created the plugin with the mindset of making a great-sounding plugin first and foremost, with a visually-appealing aesthetic following that.

For Windows users, you will need to setup and run the plugin on your computer. For this you will need
* [Projucer](https://juce.com/ "https://juce.com/")
* [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ "https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/")

Please refer to a youtube guide or the JUCE website if you are unsure on how to begin! We recommend this [video by Miskat Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGzSSNjbXlA "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGzSSNjbXlA") or the [JUCE Tutorials Page](https://juce.com/learn/tutorials "https://juce.com/learn/tutorials").

Another great source of help we can recommend is [The Audio Programmer Youtube Page](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKb02FsH4WH4X_2xhIoJ1A "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpKb02FsH4WH4X_2xhIoJ1A") 

## Initial Delay In-depth (WORK IN PROGRESS)

Initial Delay was primarily built with [Projucer](https://juce.com/ "https://juce.com/")/[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/ "https://developer.apple.com/xcode/") as a plugin suited specifically to those who maybe don’t know their way round plugins, but are wanting something cool and intuitive to add that extra “oomph!” to their work.

It utilises an always-active low-pass IIR filter and an optional delay. IIR filter stands for an Infinite Impulse Response filter, which is unique with how the decay never really reaches zero (to put it simply!). We choose to use this as we personally thought it sounded the best out of the different kinds of filters that we tested. 

The IIR filter has two parameters that you can change; the frequency Cutoff and the Q-Factor. 
* The Cuttoff knob changes the maximum frequency that the filter will let through (as a low-pass filter)
* The Q-Factor knob changes the resonance or **Q** of the filter

The Delay feature has one parameter that you can change; the Time value. 
* The Time knob changes the overall length of the Delay (ie how long it delays)

If you want to essentially “turn off” the delay, just turn the delay Time knob to its lowest value. 

Here is a setup that we recommend to get you started with the plugin. It creates a really subtle distortion with just the low frequencies coming through, creating a nice rumble or pulse depending on what you are putting through it.
